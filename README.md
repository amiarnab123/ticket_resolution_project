# Ticket Resolution and Priority Prediction System

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a robust **Ticket Resolution and Priority Prediction System** tailored for product-based companies. It leverages machine learning and data analytics to:

- Predict ticket priorities efficiently.
- Optimize ticket resolution workflows.
- Enhance customer satisfaction by reducing resolution time.

## Features

- **Automated Priority Prediction**: Accurately predicts the priority of incoming tickets based on historical data.
- **Dynamic Workflow Optimization**: Streamlines ticket resolution by assigning tasks to appropriate teams or individuals.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Provides real-time insights into ticket resolution metrics.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle increasing ticket volumes seamlessly.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Web Framework**: Flask/Django (to host the prediction service)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL/MySQL
